    "This is a very long paragraph, Saturday morning in late March. I was alone and took a long walk, though I also carried a book of the Alone, which companioned me. The day was clear, unnaturally clear,like a freshly wiped pane of glass, a window over the water, and blue, preternaturally blue, like the sky in a Magritte painting,and cold, vividly cold, so that you could clap your hands and rememberwinter, which had left a few moments ago— if you strained you could almost see itdisappearing over the hills in a black parka. Spring was coming but hadn't arrived yet.I walked on the edge of the park. The wind whispered a secret to the trees,which held their breath and scarcely moved. On the other side of the street, the skyscrapers stood on tiptoe.\nThis is a very long paragraph, Saturday morning in late March.

    "I walked down to the pier to watch the launching of a passenger ship. Ice had broken up on the river and the water rippled smoothly in blue light. The moon was a faint smudge in the clouds, a brushstroke, an afterthoughtin the vacant mind of the sky. Seagulls materialized out of vaporamidst the masts and flags. Don't let our voices die on land,they cawed, swooping down for fish and then soaring back upwards.\n I walked down to the pier to watch the launching of a passenger ship.

    'The kiosks were opening and couples moved slowly past them, arm in arm, festive. Children darted in and out of walkways, which sprouted with vendors. Voices greeted the air. Kites and balloons. Handmade signs. Voyages to unknown places. The whole day had the drama of an expectation. Down at the water, the queenly ship started moving away from the pier. Banners fluttered. The passengers clustered at the rails on deck. I stood with the people on shore and waved goodbye to the travelers. Some were jubilant; others were broken-hearted. I have always been both. Suddenly, a great cry went up. The ship set sail for the horizon and rumbled into the future but the cry persisted and cut the air like an iron bell ringing in an empty church. I looked around the pier but everyone else was gone and I was left alone to peer into the ghostly distance. I had no idea where that ship was going but I felt lucky to see it off and bereft when it disappeared. \n The kiosks were opening and couples moved slowly past them, arm in arm, festive.
